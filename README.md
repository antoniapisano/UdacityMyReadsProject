Introduction to the Udacity MyReads Project

The objective of this project is to take Udacity's starter code for a bookshelf app on React and add functionality to it. The app is supposed to allow you to search books using the Books.API supplied in the starter code, and then you can place it on the appropriate shelf depending on whether you are "Currently Reading", "Want To Read" or have "Read". It is a reading list management app for the user. The starter code can be found here: https://github.com/udacity/nd0191-c1-myreads/.

Installing the App

In order to install this app you simply need to:

- Clone from https://github.com/antoniapisano/UdacityMyReadsProject
  -Open the folder in VSCode (or similar).
  -Run "npm install" in the terminal.
  -Run "npm start".

Important

The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a few search terms so not every search term will work.
